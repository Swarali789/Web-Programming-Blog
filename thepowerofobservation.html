In quantum theory, the observer effect demonstrates how the act of observing can influence reality. 
This concept arises from experiments like the double-slit experiment, where particles such as electrons 
can behave as both particles and waves. When not observed, they exist in a state of superposition, 
embodying multiple possibilities at once. However, when an observer measures or interacts with the 
system, the wave function collapses, and the particle behaves in a more definite way. This suggests that 
the very act of observation shapes reality, implying that the universe is not simply a passive entity, but 
one that responds to the conscious awareness of an observer.This idea parallels the teachings of Krishna 
in the Bhagavad Gita, where perception plays a central role in shaping one’s experience of the world. 
Krishna emphasizes that one's understanding and approach to life can deeply affect the nature of their 
reality. He advises Arjuna to perform his duties without attachment to the fruits of his actions. In other 
words, Krishna teaches that it is not the external outcomes, but the internal perception and attitude that 
define how we experience the world. By acting with detachment and focusing on duty, without being 
consumed by the results, Arjuna can transcend the cycle of desire and suffering.Krishna's emphasis on 
detachment aligns with the concept that one’s perception can influence reality. If a person clings to the 
outcomes of their actions or becomes emotionally attached to the results, it creates a distorted view of 
the world, leading to frustration, anxiety, and suffering. On the other hand, by maintaining a detached 
yet engaged approach, individuals can navigate life with clarity, peace, and a deeper understanding of 
their true nature. This parallels quantum theory’s message that observation itself plays a role in shaping 
what is observed—what we focus on and how we interpret it can influence the path we take.Both 
perspectives—quantum theory and the teachings of Krishna—reveal that reality is not a fixed, external 
construct, but one that is influenced by our perception and consciousness. Quantum mechanics suggests 
that the act of observation causes reality to unfold in specific ways, while Krishna’s teachings indicate 
that through perception and detachment, one can influence their inner experience and relationship 
with the external world. By adopting a mindset of detached engagement, as Krishna advises, we can 
align ourselves with the deeper flow of existence, seeing beyond the surface and experiencing life more 
fully.In both cases, the power of observation is not just about looking at things, but about how we 
engage with them, which ultimately shapes our experience of reality.
