Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum physics that shows 
how particles, when entangled, remain connected regardless of the distance between 
them. Once particles become entangled, their states are so interdependent that the 
state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other, no matter how 
far apart they are. This phenomenon challenges the classical understanding of separateness 
in the universe. According to classical physics, objects should only be affected by each other 
if there is some direct interaction or force between them. However, entanglement suggests 
that particles are linked in ways that bypass the constraints of distance and time.On the other 
hand, in spiritual traditions like Hinduism, the concept of interconnectedness is similarly 
emphasized, particularly through the teachings of Krishna in texts like the Bhagavad Gita. 
Krishna, who represents the divine in Hindu philosophy, emphasizes that all beings are part 
of a single universal consciousness, often described as Brahman. According to this view, 
every individual, every living creature, and even inanimate objects are interconnected in 
the vast web of existence. The separation we perceive between ourselves and the world is 
an illusion (Maya), a veil that clouds the true unity of all things.Krishna teaches that through 
devotion, selfless action, and knowledge, one can come to realize this inherent 
interconnectedness with the divine and all beings. This realization helps transcend the ego’s 
sense of isolation and opens the way for experiencing oneness with the universe. In this 
spiritual sense, the individual self (Atman) is not separate from the divine; rather, it is a 
reflection or part of the larger cosmic self.When viewed together, quantum entanglement 
and Krishna’s teachings point to the same profound truth: the apparent separateness of 
things is an illusion, and everything in the universe is connected in ways that transcend 
our limited understanding. Just as quantum entanglement challenges our perception of 
space and time, Krishna’s teachings challenge the perception of individual separateness, 
inviting us to recognize the fundamental unity of existence.Both highlight a deeper truth 
about the nature of reality: the universe is a dynamic, interconnected whole, where every 
action, thought, and being plays a role in the cosmic dance. Whether through the lens of 
modern physics or ancient wisdom, the message is clear: all things are interrelated, and the 
separation we feel is temporary and superficial, while the underlying unity is eternal.
