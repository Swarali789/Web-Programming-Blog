In quantum physics, the concept of a hidden, deeper reality is fundamental to understanding 
the nature of the quantum world. Quantum mechanics reveals that the behavior of particles 
at the microscopic level does not always align with our everyday understanding of reality. 
For instance, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and can be 
entangled across vast distances, where their states are instantaneously connected, regardless 
of space. These behaviors are not observable with our physical senses and challenge the classical, 
materialist view of the universe. The deeper reality that governs the quantum world is invisible 
to the naked eye and requires advanced instruments and theoretical models to even begin 
to comprehend. This hidden nature of quantum reality suggests that what we perceive with 
our senses is only a surface-level view of a far more complex and mysterious underlying order 
that governs the universe. Similarly, in the teachings of Krishna, particularly in the Bhagavad 
Gita, there is a strong emphasis on the idea that the material world is an illusion, or Maya. 
According to Krishna, the physical world and all of its forms are transient, constantly 
changing, and ultimately impermanent. What we perceive as reality—our bodies, the world 
around us, and the objects we interact with—is not the ultimate truth but rather an illusion 
that distracts us from understanding the deeper, spiritual reality. Krishna teaches that true 
reality lies in the spiritual realm, which is eternal and beyond the limitations of the material 
world. This spiritual realm is the realm of the Atman (the eternal soul) and Brahman 
(the universal consciousness), both of which transcend time and space.Both quantum physics 
and Krishna’s teachings point to the idea that there is much more to reality than meets the 
eye. In quantum physics, the hidden reality of quantum phenomena exists beyond our direct 
sensory perception and often defies the logic of classical physics. Likewise, Krishna’s teachings 
urge us to look beyond the material world to recognize the true, eternal nature of existence. 
The material world, while seemingly real and concrete, is ultimately fleeting and illusory. Only 
by transcending the material realm through spiritual practice, devotion, and self-realization can 
one begin to understand the true nature of reality.The connection between these two 
perspectives lies in their shared message that the physical world is not the ultimate or final truth. 
In quantum physics, we see that the observable world only offers a glimpse into the true, deeper 
quantum reality, which we can’t fully grasp through our senses. Similarly, in Krishna’s philosophy, 
the material world is seen as a temporary appearance, while the true, eternal reality is spiritual in 
nature and cannot be perceived through ordinary sensory experience. Both perspectives challenge 
us to look beyond the apparent and the material to uncover the profound, invisible truths that lie 
beneath the surface.Quantum physics encourages us to accept that there are unseen forces and 
laws at play, shaping reality in ways that are not immediately obvious. Krishna teaches that our 
spiritual journey is about awakening to this deeper, invisible truth—that the soul is eternal and 
part of the divine, and the material world is just a transient experience. Both invite us to see reality 
as a more intricate, multifaceted phenomenon that goes beyond the surface-level appearances of 
the material world. They inspire us to explore deeper dimensions of existence, where true 
understanding and enlightenment await.
