<pre><h3>
In quantum physics, reality is not as fixed or concrete as it appears. Subatomic particles, such 
as electrons, can exist in multiple states at once, a phenomenon called superposition. This 
challenges the classical notion that particles have definite properties at all times. Instead, 
their position, velocity, and other characteristics exist as probabilities until observed. This 
suggests that the universe at its core is fluid, uncertain, and interconnected, not simply a 
collection of static objects.Similarly, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna teaches Arjuna that 
the physical world is temporary and constantly changing. He encourages Arjuna to look 
beyond the fleeting nature of material existence and focus on the eternal soul (Atman). 
Krishna explains that while the body undergoes birth, death, and decay, the soul remains 
unchanged, transcending the physical realm.Both quantum physics and the Gita point to a 
deeper reality beyond the physical world. In quantum mechanics, this deeper reality is 
governed by probabilities and wave functions, which are not directly observable but define 
the underlying nature of existence. In the Gita, the deeper reality is the eternal, unchanging 
Atman, which is beyond the illusion of the material world.In both perspectives, reality is not
 as solid or predictable as we might think. Quantum physics reveals that what we observe is 
only a small part of the story, shaped by our interaction with it. Likewise, the Gita teaches 
that what we perceive as real our bodies, the material worldâ€”are transient and should not 
be the focus of our attachment. The essence of reality transcends both the physical and the 
observable, urging us to recognize a deeper, more fundamental truth.
